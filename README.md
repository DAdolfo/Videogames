# Videogames
## Portfolio

This project is part of my portfolio, and what better way to go about it than with proper GitHub implementation?

Here I will analyze the historic sales behavior in different platforms, genres and years for many videogames and their respective publishers.

Currently our company has many good proposals for development, and like everyone, is looking for the best opportunity to invest time and resources into it.

Therefore they have asked me to find the best genre and platform option to choose from our option pool.

This will be done by analyzing the way sales have worked for publishers in the past with similar trajectories as ours, how profitable different platforms have been and the changes through time all this patters have shown.
